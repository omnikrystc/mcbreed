MC Breed
========

Breeding reference/checkoff for minecraft. Specificially made around tree and bee breeding in minecraft (Monster pack).  

Easy enough to expand into other things like crafting or other type tracking. For now renamed to mcbreed since I want to keep its purpose clear until I decide to do more with it.

Also, the design is intended to be a webapp but caching is commented out until I get it ready to demo.

scripts/analytics.js
--------------------
This file is ignored by git but needs to be created. It should either contain your Google analytics code or be an empty file so no errors are thrown for it missing. Not the best way to do it but this keeps analytics stuff out of the repository so it works for now.

scripts/libraries
-----------------
This directory contains the external libraries. They are ignored by git so you'll need to download them. Check the README or the index.html header to see which ones you'll need to provide.
